Problem 1:

Files included:
	1- Sort.java // Driver code
	2- MergeSort.java // Contains the logic for Merge Sort
	3- InsertionSort.java // Contains the logic for Insertion Sort
	4- Report.doc // Includes the table showing performance comparison between MergeSort Generic/primitive int and Insertion sort.

Input for Sort.java:
	Size of the array to be sorted

Output:
	Time taken and memory occupied for various size of input array.
	

Sample Execution of Sort.java:

Enter the size in millions:
1
Merge Sort-- Primitive int Array:
Time: 163 msec.
Memory: 83 MB / 1963 MB.

Merge Sort-- Generic Array:
Time: 709 msec.
Memory: 83 MB / 1963 MB.

Insertion Sort-- Generic Array:

	
Note: InsertionSort takes longer time to execute, so we conclude it to be infinity.

Problem 2:

Files included:
	1- Diameter.java
	2- BFS.java

Input for Diameter.java:
	Graph with edges and vertices.

Output:
	Diameter path for the given Graph.
